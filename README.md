# DataFest-Attorney-Recommendation-Predicative-Model
For a local data competition, my team (Nathan Theng, Daniel Theng, Nick Tom, Emma Andrade) created a recommendation and predicative models in Python for attorneys and clients based on the data that was given to use for the competition

The project consisted of the following: 
#1 Basic data cleaning to understand the data better
#2 Recommendation Model to recommend top 13 Attorneys based on the clients need via their conversation (provided in the data)
#3 Predicative Model
